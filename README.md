I share passion for sports & adrenaline in general - martial arts in particular. Tech background, an extrovert kind that happens to love business as well. Blockchain enthusiast and an aspiring wannabe entrepreneur, hopefully an altruist one - the time will tell. 

During my IT career I was priviledged to have a chance and play with various programming languages, frameworks and tech stacks in general, as well as with various tooling. In a sense, I see all of it simply as a toolset, nothing less and nothing more - a bounded set of steps/commands/methods/apps/tools you utilize to solve a certain challenge. But enough of philosophical overviews for now.
